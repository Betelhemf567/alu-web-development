# **CSS Advanced: Styling Webpages**
## **Project Overview**
In this project, we will enhance the webpage built in the HTML Advanced project by applying CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS is used to control the appearance of HTML elements, such as fonts, colors, layouts, and more, to create a visually appealing webpage.

## **What is CSS?**
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used to define the look and feel of a webpage. It controls the layout, fonts, colors, spacing, and interactive effects, transforming basic HTML into an engaging design.

## **Project Goals**
Text Styling: Control font types, sizes, and colors.
Colors & Backgrounds: Apply background colors, images, and gradients.
Box Model: Adjust padding, margin, and borders for spacing.
Layout: Use float, flexbox, and grid systems for positioning elements.
Responsive Design: Use media queries to ensure the webpage looks great on all devices.
Interactive Effects: Apply transitions and hover effects for a dynamic user experience.
Why CSS?
While HTML provides structure, CSS adds style and enhances user experience. It allows us to create responsive designs and visually appealing pages that work across devices.
## **Conclusion**
By the end of this project, you'll have styled a webpage using advanced CSS techniques, including layout control, responsive design, and interactive effects. Let's get started and bring your webpage to life with CSS!
