#**Project Title: HTML Structure Implementation**


#**Description**
This project involves building the HTML structure of a webpage based on a designer file provided on Figma. The focus is purely on semantic HTMLâ€”no CSS, no styles, just the layout and content in its most basic form.


**Objectives**
-Implement the HTML structure from scratch.
-Ensure proper use of HTML semantics (headings, lists, sections, articles, etc.).
-No styles or CSS are to be applied during this stage.
Requirements
Figma Design: Access the design in Figma by creating an account and duplicating the project to your drafts. The design includes the following details:

Fonts: Source Sans Pro and Spin-Cycle-OT (if you don't have them, they can be downloaded from Figma).
*Float values:* Feel free to round them for simplicity.


**HTML Markup:**  Create a clean and semantically correct HTML structure.

**No Styles:** Focus only on the structure, no CSS or visual styling in this phase.
